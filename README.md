These files created for survival estimation for sea turtles.

1. Before conducting analysis, you should create new folder named "Program" and copy all programs into the folder.
2. If you installed Rstudio, open files named "Cal_CatchCurve.R" and puch "source" for conducting analysis using Sample_SCL data. 
3. If you have Width_Radius data from humeris and SCL_Radius data from stranged sea turtles, make these files as same formed csv data as Sample_WR or Sample_SR.

The following is an explanation of the file-------------------------

Cal_CatchCurve.R ... conducting all programs.
Width_Radius.R ... conducting estimation of growth curves of humeri.
SCL_Radius.R ... conducting estimation of relationships between SCL and Radius of humeri.
SCLdistribution.R ... conducting catch-curve analysis using prior distribution obtained from above 2 estimation.

ExistingMethod.R ... conducting existing catch-curve analysis.

Sample_WR ... sample humerus data consists of relationships between humerus radius and humerus width.
Sample_SR ... sample SCL and humerus data consists of relationships between SCL and humerus radius.
Sample_SCL ... sample SCL distribution data.
